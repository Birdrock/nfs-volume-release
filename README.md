# NFS-Volume Release

This repository is a [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh)
release for deploying nfsbroker and nfsv3driver to provision existing
NFS volumes and bind those volumes to your applications for shared file
access.

Additionally, `nfstestserver` and `nfstestldapserver` jobs provide a
server for tests to target with which you can try out volume mounts.

For information on getting started with Cloud Foundry look at the docs
for [CF Deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment).
